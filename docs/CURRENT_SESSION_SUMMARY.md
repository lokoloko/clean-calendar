## Completed in This Session

### 1. ✅ Cleaner Reassignment Feature
- **What**: Added ability to change assigned cleaner for any scheduled cleaning

  - `/src/app/schedule/page.tsx` - Added Actions column and reassignment modal
- **How it works**:
  - Actions dropdown in schedule list view
  - Modal to select new cleaner
  - Validation prevents reassigning past or completed cleanings
  - Toast notifications for success/error

### 2. ✅ Production Readiness Tasks
While user worked on Google OAuth setup, completed:

#### Environment Configuration
- Created `/src/lib/env.ts` for type-safe environment access
- Added validation and helper functions

#### Health Check Endpoints
- `/api/health` - General health with database/memory checks
- `/api/health/ready` - Readiness probe
- `/api/health/live` - Liveness check

#### Logging System
- Created `/src/lib/logger.ts` with structured logging
- Development and production modes
- Request middleware for API logging

#### Database Connection Pooling
- Created `/src/lib/db-production.ts`
- Optimized for serverless environments
- Retry logic and connection monitoring

#### Documentation
- Production deployment guide
- Environment variables template
- API documentation
- Production readiness status tracking

### 3. ✅ Supabase CLI Installation
- Homebrew installation failed due to XCode tools issue
- Successfully installed via direct binary download
- Installed to `~/bin/supabase` (version 2.31.8)
- Successfully linked to project: `puvlcvcbxmobxpnbjrwp`

### 4. ✅ Multi-Select Property Filter for Schedule
- **What**: Added ability to filter schedule by multiple properties
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/app/schedule/page.tsx` - Added multi-select dropdown and filtering logic
- **How it works**:
  - New dropdown between cleaner filter and "Show cancelled" checkbox
  - Shows "All Properties" when none selected or count when filtered
  - Popover with checkboxes for each property
  - "Select All/Clear All" button for convenience
  - Filters apply to all views: list, weekly, and monthly
  - Manual properties show a badge for easy identification

### 5. ✅ Code Cleanup
- Removed misleading TODO comments about toast notifications
- Identified obsolete cleaner edit page (inline editing already implemented)
- Preserved intentional comments for future implementations (SMS, error tracking)
