# Quick Start Guide Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive 5-step quick start guide to help new users set up their cleaning schedule automation quickly and efficiently.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Quick Start Guide Flow
- **Step 1**: Connect Airbnb Calendar - Import bookings via ICS URL
- **Step 2**: Add Cleaners - Set up cleaning staff with contact information
- **Step 3**: Assign Properties - Link cleaners to specific properties
- **Step 4**: Export Schedule - Share cleaning schedules with staff
- **Step 5**: Celebration - Confetti animation and setup summary

### 2. Progress Tracking System
- Created `useQuickStartProgress` hook for state management
- Progress persisted in localStorage with key `gostudiom_quick_start_progress`
- Tracks: current step, completed steps, timestamps, skip status
- Auto-detection of completed actions (e.g., when user adds first cleaner)

### 3. UI Components Created
- **ProgressBar**: Visual progress indicator with step navigation
  - Horizontal layout on desktop, vertical on mobile
  - Interactive step indicators (click to navigate)
- **StepWrapper**: Consistent card wrapper for each step
- **CalendarConnect**: URL validation and calendar connection
- **CleanerSetup**: Add/manage cleaners with phone formatting
- **PropertyAssignment**: Quick assign and individual assignments
- **ScheduleExport**: Preview and copy schedule to clipboard
- **CompletionCelebration**: Success screen with confetti animation

### 4. Navigation Enhancement
- Added Quick Start link to sidebar with "NEW" badge
- Positioned after Dashboard for maximum visibility
- Used Sparkles icon for visual appeal

### 5. Call-to-Action Banner
- **QuickStartBanner** component for dashboard
- Smart display logic:
  - Only shows for new users
  - Hides if quick start completed or skipped
  - Hides if user has completed 3+ steps
  - Dismissible with localStorage persistence
- Shows progress if partially completed

### 6. Format Utilities
Created centralized formatting utilities in `/src/lib/format-utils.ts`:
- **formatTimeDisplay**: Converts 24-hour time to 12-hour AM/PM format
- **formatPhoneForDisplay**: Formats phone numbers as (###) ###-####

Applied formatting throughout:
- Dashboard: Checkout times now show AM/PM
- Schedule: All time displays use 12-hour format
- Cleaners: Phone numbers display in standard format
