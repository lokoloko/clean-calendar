# Cleaner Calendar Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a mobile-first calendar system for cleaners that maintains complete separation between different hosts/users. When a cleaner works for multiple hosts, they see separate calendars for each host rather than a unified view.

## Architecture

### Data Model
- Each user maintains their own cleaner records
- Same physical cleaner (same phone) can exist as separate records for different users
- Cleaner authentication is phone-based, finding all cleaner records with that phone number
- Complete data isolation between hosts

### User Flow
1. **Cleaner Login**: Authenticates with phone number via SMS
2. **Host Selection**: Sees all hosts they work for with key metrics
3. **Host Calendar**: Views schedule for selected host only
4. **View Modes**: Can switch between List, Week, and Month views
5. **Property Filter**: Can filter by specific properties within a host

## Implementation Details

### 1. Host Selection Page (`/app/cleaner/hosts/page.tsx`)
- Displays cards for each host the cleaner works for
- Shows:
  - Host name/company
  - Number of properties
  - Cleanings today
  - Cleanings this week
- Summary stats at top (total for today/week across all hosts)
- Touch-optimized cards with hover/active states

### 2. Host-Specific Calendar (`/app/cleaner/calendar/[hostId]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamic route that accepts host user ID
- Header shows host name/company
- Three view modes with toggle buttons
- Property filter dropdown
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### 3. Calendar View Components

#### List View (`/components/cleaner/calendar-list-view.tsx`)
- Groups cleanings by date
- Sticky date headers for context while scrolling
- Detailed cards showing:
  - Property name
  - Time
  - Guest name
  - Status badges
  - Feedback indicators
- Visual emphasis on today's incomplete tasks

#### Week View (`/components/cleaner/calendar-week-view.tsx`)
- 7-day grid layout
- Swipe gestures for week navigation
- Compact cards within each day
- Today highlighted in blue
- Week summary at bottom

#### Month View (`/components/cleaner/calendar-month-view.tsx`)
- Traditional calendar grid
- Day cells show cleaning count badges
- Tap day to see details in bottom sheet
- Month navigation with prev/next buttons
- Visual indicators for pending tasks

### 4. API Endpoints

#### GET `/api/cleaner/hosts`
Returns all hosts for the authenticated cleaner:
```json
{
  "cleanerPhone": "5551234",
  "hosts": [
    {
      "userId": "uuid",
      "cleanerId": "uuid",
      "hostName": "John Doe",
      "companyName": "Doe Rentals",
      "propertyCount": 5,
      "upcomingCleanings": 12,
      "todayCleanings": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GET `/api/cleaner/calendar/[hostId]`
Returns schedule for specific host:
```json
{
  "hostInfo": {
    "hostName": "John Doe",
    "companyName": "Doe Rentals",
    "cleanerId": "uuid"
  },
  "properties": [
    {"id": "uuid", "name": "Beach House"}
  ],
  "schedule": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "checkIn": "2024-01-15",
      "checkOut": "2024-01-18",
      "checkoutTime": "11:00 AM",
      "listingName": "Beach House",
      "guestName": "Jane Smith",
      "status": "scheduled",
      "isCompleted": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Database Methods

Added `getCleanersByPhone` to `db-edge.ts`:
```typescript
async getCleanersByPhone(phone: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('cleaners')
    .select('*')
    .eq('phone', phone)
  return data || []
}
```

## Mobile Optimizations

### Touch Targets
- All interactive elements minimum 44px (11mm)
- Buttons use `min-h-touch` class
- Cards have touch feedback with `active:scale-[0.98]`

### Navigation
- Swipe gestures in week view
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Sticky headers for context
- Bottom sheet for month view details

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoints for tablet/desktop
- Horizontal scroll prevention
- Safe area padding for notched devices

## Visual Design

### Status Indicators
- Orange pulse dot for today's incomplete tasks
- Color-coded badges (green=completed, orange=today, blue=scheduled)
- Feedback indicators with emoji ratings

### Host Differentiation
- Each host calendar clearly labeled
- Back navigation to host selection
- No visual mixing of different hosts' data

## Benefits

1. **Privacy**: Complete data separation between hosts
2. **Clarity**: No confusion about which properties belong to whom
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add more hosts
4. **Organization**: Cleaners can focus on one host at a time
5. **Flexibility**: Each host's schedule managed independently

## Future Enhancements

1. **Host Colors**: Assign color themes to each host
2. **Notifications**: Host-specific SMS reminders
3. **Export**: Generate schedules per host
4. **Analytics**: Performance metrics by host
5. **Offline Support**: Cache schedules for offline viewing
