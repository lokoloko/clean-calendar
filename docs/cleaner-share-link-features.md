## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

#### Get Schedule
`GET /api/cleaner/schedule/[token]`
- Uses PostgreSQL RPC functions with SECURITY DEFINER
- Bypasses Row Level Security for unauthenticated access
- Returns cleaner info and full schedule

#### Submit Feedback
`POST /api/cleaner/schedule/[token]/feedback`
- Validates share token
- Verifies cleaning assignment
- Creates or updates feedback record
- Returns success confirmation

### Database Functions
PostgreSQL functions with SECURITY DEFINER:
- `get_cleaner_by_token(share_token)` - Returns cleaner details
- `get_cleaner_schedule_by_token(share_token)` - Returns schedule items

### Security
- Token-based authentication (32-character random tokens)
- Tokens have expiration dates
- No sensitive data exposed
- Read-only access except for feedback submission
- RPC functions ensure data isolation
