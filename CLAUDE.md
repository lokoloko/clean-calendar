## Branch Strategy

- **`local` branch**: Development environment with local Supabase
- **`main` branch**: Production environment with Supabase cloud

## Essential Commands

### Development (local branch)
```bash
git checkout local       # Switch to development branch
supabase start          # Start local Supabase
npm run dev             # Start development server on port 9002 with Turbopack
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run start           # Start production server
npm run lint            # Run Next.js linter
npm run typecheck       # Run TypeScript type checking
npm run genkit:dev      # Start Genkit AI development server
npm run genkit:watch    # Start Genkit with watch mode
```

### Docker Commands (Alternative to Supabase CLI)
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build  # Start Docker environment with PostgreSQL
docker-compose down           # Stop Docker environment
docker-compose restart app    # Restart app container
docker logs clean-calendar-app-1  # View app logs
docker exec -it clean-calendar-app-1 sh  # Access app container shell
```

### Common Development Tasks
```bash
# Run a specific component in development
npm run dev -- --port 3000

# Check types before committing
npm run typecheck

# Run linter with auto-fix
npm run lint -- --fix
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with direct client connections
- **Authentication**: Custom SMS-based authentication for cleaners
- **AI**: Google Genkit for schedule optimization
- **Hosting**: Vercel for production deployment

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### 1. App Router Structure
All pages use Next.js 15 App Router in `src/app/`. Each route has:
- `page.tsx` - The page component
- `layout.tsx` (if needed) - Layout wrapper
- Server components by default, use `'use client'` when needed

#### 2. Component Organization
- `src/components/ui/` - shadcn/ui components (40+ components)
- `src/components/` - Feature-specific components
- Components follow the pattern: `export function ComponentName() {}`

#### 3. Data Flow
- Database operations in `src/lib/db.ts`
- Types defined in `src/types/`
- Custom hooks in `src/hooks/`
- AI flows in `src/ai/flows/`
- Cleaner authentication in `src/lib/cleaner-auth.ts`

#### 4. Styling Approach
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- CSS variables for theming (defined in globals.css)
- Design system colors:
  - Primary: `hsl(var(--primary))` (teal)
  - Background: `hsl(var(--background))` (off-white)
  - Accent: `hsl(var(--accent))` (muted blue)

### Important Patterns

#### Form Handling
Use React Hook Form with Zod schemas:
```typescript
const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
  defaultValues: { /* ... */ }
})
```

#### Path Imports
Use the `@/` alias for imports:
```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { cleaners } from "@/data/cleaners"
```

#### Client Components
Mark components that use hooks or browser APIs:
```typescript
'use client'

export function InteractiveComponent() {
  // Component with useState, useEffect, etc.
}
```

## Key Features and Routes

### Admin/Manager Routes
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard with metrics
- `/listings` - Property management with ICS integration
- `/cleaners` - Cleaner directory and management
- `/assignments` - Link cleaners to properties
- `/schedule` - View and manage cleaning schedule (list, weekly, monthly views)
- `/manual-schedules` - Manage recurring manual cleanings
- `/feedback` - View and analyze cleaner feedback
- `/stats` - Analytics and performance metrics
- `/settings` - Sync settings and preferences

### Mobile Cleaner Portal
- `/cleaner` - SMS-based login for cleaners
- `/cleaner/verify` - SMS code verification
- `/cleaner/dashboard` - Mobile dashboard with today's cleanings

- `/share/[token]` - Public schedule sharing

## Development Notes

- TypeScript errors are ignored during builds (see next.config.ts)
- ESLint errors are also ignored in production builds
- Port 9002 is the default development port
- **Development**: Use `local` branch with local Supabase instance
- **Production**: Use `main` branch with Supabase cloud
- Database migrations are in `supabase/migrations/`
- SMS authentication bypassed for testing (uses mock-token)
- **Authentication**: Dev mode uses mock auth - click "Sign in with Google" to set dev cookie
- **Recent Fixes (2025-07-31)**: 
  - RLS performance optimized - all auth.uid() calls now cached
  - Missing user_settings table created in production
  - Security settings configured - OTP expiry reduced, leaked password protection enabled
  - Mobile optimization complete with responsive components

## Docker Development Setup (Alternative to Supabase CLI)

**Note**: Docker setup is for development only. For production, use Supabase cloud.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use Docker commands for local development. Do NOT use `npm run dev` directly.

1. **Start the environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run docker:dev
   # OR
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. **View logs** (essential for debugging auth issues):
   ```bash
   docker logs -f clean-calendar-app-1
   ```

3. **Restart after environment changes**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart app
   ```

4. **Access services**:
   - App: http://localhost:9002
   - Cleaner Portal: http://localhost:9002/cleaner/dashboard
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5433 (postgres/postgres)

5. **Environment variables**:
   **For Development (local branch)**:
   - DATABASE_URL: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54321/postgres`
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: `http://localhost:54321`
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: (from `supabase start` output)
   - CRON_SECRET: (generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
   
   **For Production (main branch)**:
   - DATABASE_URL: Get from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > Database
     - Format: `postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@db.[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co:5432/postgres`
     - Example: `postgresql://postgres:abc123xyz@db.puvlcvcbxmobxpnbjrwp.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: `https://[YOUR-PROJECT-REF].supabase.co`
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: Get from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
   
   **For Docker Development**:
   - DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/cleansweep
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: (Set in .env.local)
   - NEXTAUTH_URL: http://localhost:9002
