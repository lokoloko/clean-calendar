## 🛠️ Technical Debt

### Low Priority but Should Address
- ESLint configuration fix ("next/core-web-vitals" warning)

## 📝 Notes

The application is **fully functional for production use** with the understanding that SMS notifications are temporarily unavailable. All other features work perfectly, and the system is stable for daily operations.

**Recommendation**: Launch with current features, market as "SMS coming soon" to start gathering user feedback while awaiting Twilio approval.
