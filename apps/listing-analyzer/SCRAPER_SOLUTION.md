# Airbnb Listing Scraper - Hybrid Solution

## Overview
This document describes the hybrid scraping solution that combines Browserless.io's Function API with Google's Gemini Vision AI to extract comprehensive data from Airbnb listings.

## Problem Statement
The original scraper had regressed from ~75% to 0% data extraction due to:
- Overly complex architecture (12+ scraper files)
- Broken modal interactions
- Incompatibility with Browserless API changes
- Issues with Vercel Edge Runtime

## Solution Architecture

### Hybrid Approach
The solution uses a "hybrid light" approach that combines:
1. **Browserless Function API** - For browser automation and screenshot capture
2. **Gemini Vision AI** - For extracting structured data from screenshots
3. **Fallback Chain** - Multiple extraction methods with graceful degradation

### Key Components

#### 1. Working Function Scraper (`scraper-working-function.ts`)
- Uses Browserless Function API with ESM module format
- Captures main page and modal screenshots
- Handles modal interactions (reviews, amenities, safety, etc.)
- Returns base64-encoded JPEG screenshots

#### 2. Vision AI Extraction
- Processes screenshots with Gemini 1.5 Flash
- Extracts structured JSON data from images
- Handles multiple modal types with specific prompts

#### 3. Hybrid Orchestrator (`scraper-hybrid.ts`)
- Tries multiple extraction methods in sequence
- Tracks metrics for each attempt
- Returns best available result

## Technical Implementation

### Key Fixes Applied

1. **Function API Compatibility**
   - Fixed `page.waitForTimeout is not a function` error
   - Replaced with: `await page.evaluate(() => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms)))`

2. **Screenshot Encoding**
   - Use `encoding: 'base64'` parameter in page.screenshot()
   - JPEG format with quality settings for size optimization

3. **Modal Handling**
   - Dismiss translation/cookie modals first
   - Sequential modal opening with proper wait times
   - Escape key for modal dismissal

4. **ESM Module Format**
   ```javascript
   export default async function({ page }) {
     // Function implementation
   }
   ```

## Current Performance

### Metrics Achieved
- **Data Completeness**: 26% (from 0%)
- **Modals Captured**: 4/5 (80% success rate)
- **Processing Time**: ~33 seconds
- **Success Rate**: 100% (no failures)

### Data Extraction Coverage
| Component | Status | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Main Page | ✅ Working | Title, Price, Rating |
| Reviews | ✅ Partial | 1 review captured |
| Safety | ✅ Working | Full modal captured |
| Cancellation | ✅ Working | Policy captured |
| House Rules | ✅ Working | Rules captured |
| Amenities | ❌ Not Working | 0/21 items |

## API Endpoints

### `/api/analyze`
Main endpoint that:
1. Validates Airbnb URL
2. Runs hybrid scraper
3. Analyzes with AI
4. Returns comprehensive data + analysis

## Environment Variables Required
```bash
BROWSERLESS_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Amenities Modal** - Not capturing due to translation modal interference
2. **Review Pagination** - Only capturing first page (infinite scroll not fully implemented)
3. **Location Data** - Not extracting from screenshots properly
4. **Data Completeness** - 26% vs 75% target

## Future Improvements

1. **Fix Amenities Modal**
   - Better modal detection logic
   - Handle translation modal properly

2. **Implement Full Review Scrolling**
   - Capture all review pages
   - Handle infinite scroll properly

3. **Improve Vision AI Prompts**
   - Better JSON extraction
   - More specific field targeting

4. **Add Caching Layer**
   - Cache screenshots for 1 hour
   - Cache extracted data for 24 hours

5. **Use BrowserQL**
   - Browserless's query language designed for this use case
   - More reliable than Function API for complex interactions

## Testing

### Test Files
- `test-working.ts` - Tests the working function scraper
- `test-final.ts` - Tests complete pipeline
- `test-debug.ts` - Debug function API issues

### Run Tests
```bash
npx tsx test-working.ts
npx tsx test-final.ts
```

## Deployment Notes

- Compatible with Vercel Edge Runtime
- Handles 4.5MB response limit
- Optimized for serverless timeouts
- JPEG compression for smaller payloads

## Conclusion

The hybrid scraper successfully extracts data from Airbnb listings using a combination of browser automation and AI vision processing. While not yet achieving the 75% completeness target, it represents a significant improvement from 0% and provides a solid foundation for further enhancements.
