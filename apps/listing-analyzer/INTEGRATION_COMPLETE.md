import { scrapeWithEnhancedFunction } from './lib/scraper-enhanced-function'

const listing = await scrapeWithEnhancedFunction(url)

// Access rating data
console.log(listing.reviewsSummary.averageRating)  // 4.86
console.log(listing.reviewsSummary.reviewCount)     // 29
console.log(listing.reviewsSummary.categoryRatings) // All 6 categories
```
