# Phase 7: URL Capture in Upload Flow - COMPLETED

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Mapping Page (`/app/mapping/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added individual URL input fields for each property
- ✅ Implemented URL validation (checks for airbnb.com/rooms/ format)
- ✅ Visual indicators for invalid URLs (red border)
- ✅ Bulk URL paste functionality (one URL per line)
- ✅ URL count indicator (X/Y URLs)
- ✅ Help text showing correct URL format
- ✅ Tooltips explaining URL requirements
- ✅ External link button to open URLs in new tab
- ✅ Persists URLs to PropertyStore when analyzing

### 2. Optional URL Section Component (`/components/UrlInputSection.tsx`)
- ✅ Collapsible card for optional URL entry during upload
- ✅ Dynamic add/remove URL fields
- ✅ Bulk paste functionality
- ✅ Real-time validation
- ✅ Clear instructions on finding Airbnb URLs
- ✅ Valid URL counter
- ✅ Clean, user-friendly interface

### 3. Enhanced Upload Page (`/app/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Integrated UrlInputSection component
- ✅ Passes collected URLs to mapping page via sessionStorage
- ✅ Pre-populates URLs in mapping page if provided
- ✅ Maintains optional nature - users can skip URLs entirely

## Key Features

### URL Validation
- Basic validation ensures URLs contain "airbnb.com/rooms/"
- Visual feedback with red borders for invalid URLs
- Console warnings for invalid formats

### User Experience
- URLs are optional - can be added at upload or mapping stage
- Bulk paste for efficiency when adding multiple URLs
- Clear help text and examples
- Visual indicators (link icon) for properties with URLs

### Data Flow
```
Upload Page (optional URLs) 
    ↓
sessionStorage with propertyUrls array
    ↓
Mapping Page (pre-populated URLs)
    ↓
PropertyStore persistence on analyze
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Upload Page Flow**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:9003
   - Upload PDF/CSV files
   - Click "Add URLs" to expand the optional section
   - Add individual URLs or use "Bulk Add"
   - Process files - URLs are passed to mapping

2. **Mapping Page Features**:
   - Each property has a URL input field
   - Properties with URLs show a green link icon
   - "Bulk Add" button in header for pasting multiple URLs
   - URL validation shows red border for invalid formats
   - External link button opens Airbnb listing

3. **Persistence**:
   - URLs are saved to PropertyStore when clicking "Analyze Selected"
   - Property detail pages can access URLs for live data sync

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Properties work without URLs but gain features when URLs are added
2. **Flexible Entry Points**: URLs can be added during upload or at mapping stage
3. **Bulk Operations**: Efficient URL management for multiple properties
4. **Clear Guidance**: Help text and validation guide users to correct format
5. **Visual Feedback**: Icons and colors indicate URL status at a glance

## Next Steps

With Phase 7 complete, the system now has comprehensive URL management integrated into the upload flow. This enables:
- Live data synchronization (when Phase 4 completes URL management)
- Competitor analysis features
- Automated pricing recommendations
- Real-time availability tracking

The foundation is set for powerful data-driven insights once properties have their Airbnb URLs configured.
