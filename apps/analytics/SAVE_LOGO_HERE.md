# Logo Installation Instructions

To complete the logo update:

1. Save your GoStudioM logo image as:
   `/Volumes/WORKING/Projects/clean-calendar/apps/analytics/public/gostudiom-logo.png`

2. The image should be the exact PNG file you provided (the one with the teal M and "gostudiom" text)

3. Once saved, the logo will automatically appear correctly on:
   - Upload page
   - Dashboard header
   - Any other location using the GoStudioMLogo component

The component is now configured to use `/gostudiom-logo.png` from the public folder.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not convert the file type or modify the image in any way. Save it exactly as provided.
