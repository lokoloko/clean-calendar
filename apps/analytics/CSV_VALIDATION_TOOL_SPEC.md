# CSV Format Validation Tool Specification

## Overview
This document specifies a validation tool to detect when Airbnb changes their CSV export format, preventing data processing errors and maintaining system reliability.

## Problem Statement
Airbnb may change their CSV export format at any time without notice. Our current system depends on specific column names, data formats, and patterns. Any unexpected changes could cause:
- Silent data corruption
- Incorrect metric calculations
- System crashes
- User frustration

## Current CSV Format Understanding

### Schema Definition (v1.0 - December 2024)

#### Column Structure (23 columns)
| Column Name | Required | Data Type | Format | Purpose |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Date | Yes | Date | MM/DD/YYYY | Transaction date |
| Arriving by date | No | Date | MM/DD/YYYY | Payment arrival date |
| Type | Yes | Enum | Text | Transaction type |
| Confirmation code | Conditional | String | Alphanumeric | Booking identifier |
| Booking date | No | Date | MM/DD/YYYY | When reservation made |
| Start date | Conditional | Date | MM/DD/YYYY | Check-in date |
| End date | Conditional | Date | MM/DD/YYYY | Check-out date |
| Nights | Conditional | Integer | Number | Total stay duration |
| Guest | Conditional | String | Text | Guest name |
| Listing | Yes | String | Text | Property name |
| Details | No | String | Text | Transaction details |
| Reference code | No | String | Alphanumeric | Payment reference |
| Currency | Yes | String | 3-letter code | Currency code |
| Amount | Conditional | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Transaction amount |
| Paid out | Conditional | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Payout amount |
| Service fee | No | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Airbnb fee |
| Fast pay fee | No | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Express payment fee |
| Cleaning fee | No | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Cleaning charge |
| Linens fee | No | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Linens charge |
| Pet fee | No | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Pet charge |
| Gross earnings | Conditional | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Total earnings |
| Occupancy taxes | No | Currency | $X,XXX.XX | Tax amount |
| Earnings year | No | Integer | YYYY | Tax year |

#### Transaction Types
- `Reservation` - Guest bookings
- `Payout` - Host payments
- `Co-Host payout` - Co-host payments
- `Resolution Adjustment` - Refunds/adjustments

### Critical Dependencies

#### 1. Confirmation Code Pattern
- **Purpose**: Group multiple payment rows for single bookings
- **Pattern**: Alphanumeric, typically 10 characters
- **Critical**: Without this, we can't deduplicate long-term bookings

#### 2. Nights Field Behavior
- **Current**: Contains TOTAL nights for entire stay
- **Risk**: Could change to monthly nights for installment payments
- **Impact**: Would cause massive undercounting

#### 3. Date Formats
- **Current**: MM/DD/YYYY
- **Risk**: Could change to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Impact**: Parsing failures, incorrect date ranges

#### 4. Amount Formats
- **Current**: $X,XXX.XX with commas and dollar signs
- **Risk**: Could remove symbols or change decimal separator
- **Impact**: Revenue calculation errors

## Validation Rules

### Level 1: Structure Validation (Critical)

```yaml
structure_rules:
  required_columns:
    - Date
    - Type
    - Listing
    - Currency
  
  conditional_requirements:
    - if: Type == "Reservation"
      then_required:

        - Start date
        - End date
        - Nights
        - Gross earnings
    
    - if: Type == "Payout"
      then_required:
        - Paid out
        - Reference code

    expected: 23
    tolerance: Â±2  # Allow minor variations
```

### Level 2: Format Validation (Critical)

```yaml
format_rules:
  date_columns:
    pattern: "^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])/(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/\\d{4}$"
    columns:
      - Date
      - Booking date
      - Start date
      - End date
      - Arriving by date
  
  amount_columns:
    pattern: "^\\$?[0-9]{1,3}(,[0-9]{3})*\\.?[0-9]{0,2}$"
    columns:
      - Amount
      - Paid out
      - Gross earnings
      - Service fee
      - Cleaning fee
  
  integer_columns:
    pattern: "^[0-9]+$"
    columns:
      - Nights
      - Earnings year
```

### Level 3: Business Logic Validation (Warning)

```yaml
business_rules:
  confirmation_codes:
    - min_length: 8
    - max_length: 15
    - required_for: "Reservation"
    - uniqueness: "May repeat for multi-payment bookings"
  
  nights_values:
    - min: 1
    - max: 365
    - warning_if_all: "< 31"  # Might indicate format change
  
  date_logic:
    - end_date >= start_date
    - booking_date <= start_date
    - date <= arriving_by_date
  
  amount_logic:
    - gross_earnings > 0 for Reservations
    - paid_out > 0 for Payouts
    - service_fee <= gross_earnings * 0.20  # Max 20% fee
```

### Level 4: Anomaly Detection (Info)

```yaml
anomaly_patterns:
  duplicate_confirmation_rate:
    expected: "5-10%"  # Long-term bookings
    alert_if: "> 50%"  # Too many duplicates
  
  missing_confirmation_rate:
    expected: "< 1%"
    alert_if: "> 10%"
  
  nights_distribution:
    expected_median: "2-5"
    alert_if_median: "> 30"  # Possible monthly values
  
  new_transaction_types:
    action: "Log and monitor"
    alert_if: "Affects > 5% of rows"
  
  column_additions:
    action: "Log for review"
    severity: "Info unless breaks parser"
```
